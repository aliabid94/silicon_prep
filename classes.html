      <h2 class="class" id="class_1"><div class="class_number">1</div>The Foundations of Machine Learning: Finding Patterns in Data</h2>
      <p> We start by getting our terms straight: what is the difference between <em>artificial intelligence</em>, <em>machine learning</em>, and <em>deep learning</em> and do they present competing philosophies? We discuss parametric learning, and talk about common issues encountered when doing machine learning, from over-fitting to fairness and reproducibility. Along the way, each student will set up their first machine learning experiments using python notebooks. </p>
      <p> <a>Coding Exercise 1: Data Analysis with Tensorflow</a></p>
      <h2 class="class" id="class_2"><div class="class_number">2</div>From "Machine Learning" to "Deep Learning"</h2>
      <p>We quickly progress to deep learning: what are the factors that have led to the <em>deep learning revolution</em>? We understand how neural networks work, derive backpropagation intuitively, and discuss different types of neural networks. We observe the recent results that deep learning has achieved on a variety of datasets. </p>
      <h2 class="class" id="class_3"><div class="class_number">3</div>Convolutional Neural Networks: Helping Machines <em>See</em></h2>
      <p>Next, we focus on a kind of neural network popular for machine vision related tasks, convolutional neural networks. We discuss why convolutions make sense for visual tasks, and define filter sizes, strides, and other hyperparameters used in the architecture of convolutional neural networks. We show how a neural network can be quickly trained for image classification, and discuss other applications both within computer vision and beyond. </p>
      <p><a>Project 1: Shirts or Shoes? Building a Neural Network to Recognize Clothing Items</a></p>
      <h2 class="class" id="class_4"><div class="class_number">4</div>Tricks to Train Convolutional Networks</h2>
      <p>Training deep convolutional neural networks can be tricky, and recently, a variety of techniques have been proposed to improve training, from better optimizers to batch normalization. We will review these  methods and demonstrate how they can be applied successfully in practice.</p>
      <h2 class="class" id="class_5"><div class="class_number">5</div>Computer Vision Beyond Image Recognition </h2>
      <p>There's more to computer vision than just image recognition. We'll look at other tasks, such as image segmentation and figure out how to adapt convolutional neural networks to effectively carry out these tasks. </p>
      <p><a>Project 2: Smile! Training a Neural Network to Detect Facial Expression.</a></p>
      <h2 class="class" id="class_6"><div class="class_number">6</div> Interpreting Neural Networks & Fooling Them </h2>
      <p>Despite the power of neural networks, they have certain limitations as well. One is the vulnerability of neural networks to small "adversarial" perturbations that fool the neural network into making incorrect predictions. Another is the limited ability to interpret/understand what a neural network has learned. We'll discuss these problems, as well as how to address them. </p>
      <h2 class="class" id="class_7"><div class="class_number">7</div> From Images to Words: What Makes Language Difficult?</h2>
      <p>We will shift from images to words, and correspondingly from convolutional neural networks to recurrent neural networks. We'll review the key tasks in natural language processing and investigate the performance of the recurrent neural network architecture for these tasks.</p>
      <p><a>Coding Exercise 2: Gradients, Saliency Maps and Adversarial Attacks</a></p>
      <h2 class="class" id="class_8"><div class="class_number">8</div> Word Embeddings and Recurrent Neural Networks: Helping Machines <em>Read</em></h2>
      <p>We will spend some time in this class on word embeddings, which are a way to transform discrete words into continuous vectors. We will also dive more deeply into the recurrent neural network architectures and discuss popular flavors such as the LSTM and Transformer Architecture.</p>
      <h2 class="class" id="class_9"><div class="class_number">9</div> Text Classification with LSTMs</h2>
      <p>Using the LSTM architecture, we will discuss how to build text classification systems, such as sentiment classifiers. The focus of the class will be on models that take as input sequences and output single classes. </p>
      <p><a>Project 3: Shakespeare vs. Poe: Who Wrote That?</a></p>
      <h2 class="class" id="class_10"><div class="class_number">10</div> Text Translation with Sequence-Sequence Models</h2>
      <p>Using an adaptation of the LSTM architecture, we will discuss how to build text manipulation systems, such as translation models. The focus of the class will be on models that take as input sequences and output sequences.</p>
      <h2 class="class" id="class_11"><div class="class_number">11</div> Unsupervised Learning: Compressing with Autoencoders </h2>
      <p>This class, we begin the final unit of the class, which covers unsupervised learning. We review classical unsupervised learning techniques such as PCA, but quickly move to unsupervised learning in the age of deep learning. </p>
      <p> <a>Coding Exercise 4: Using Autoencoders to Visualize High-Dimensional Data</a></p>
      <h2 class="class" id="class_12"><div class="class_number">12</div> Adding Probability to the Mix: Generative Models and the Variational Autoencoders </h2>
      <p> We focus on a particular kind of unsupervised learning that has recently attracted a lot of attention: generative models. Generative models are unique, as they allow machine learning systems to generate new kinds of samples, such as new images, text, and even music! We discuss how these algorithms work, and implement an important class of generative models known as variational autoencoders.</p>
      <h2 class="class" id="class_13"><div class="class_number">13</div> When Neural Networks Compete: Generative Adversarial Networks</h2>
      <p>The most popular kind of generative model is the generative adversarial network (GAN) -- we discuss what the motivation behind the GAN, and show how to implement one. GANs are difficult to train, so we discuss recent advances that make it possible to train GANs more effectively and with exciting results. </p>
      <p><a>Project 4: Image Translation with GANs</a></p>
      <h2 class="class" id="class_14"><div class="class_number">14</div> The Future of Deep Learning (Are the Robots Coming?)</h2>
      <p>We end this class by discussing the very cutting-edge of deep learning: what are deep learning researchers working on right now, and where might they go next? We'll also discuss some project ideas and resources that the student can consult for future learning and growth.</p>
